Session: arena-1805bfdb (final integration session). Work remains on assigned branch `arena/1805bfdb-own4`; additional branches are not permitted by this environment.

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Repository audit, official-source research, methodology, dashboard, tests and Pages integration | in progress | arena-1805bfdb | README.md, COORDINATION.md, docs/**, scripts/**, tests/**, .github/workflows/**, package.json |

## Activity
- 2026-11-02: Initial repository contains only README.md (`# Own4`); no implementation, datasets, claims, credentials or other session claims found. Claimed initial implementation and final integration. No parallel tasks exist.
- Initial claim push: remote session branch did not yet exist; pull from that ref failed without changing files. Rebased against origin/main and created only the assigned remote branch. No conflict or other-session changes.
- 2026-11-02: Reviewed official NBA glossary https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary ; FAQ https://www.nba.com/stats/help/faq ; current injury index https://official.nba.com/nba-injury-report-2026-27-season/ ; NIST https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35c.htm and https://www.nist.gov/itl/sed/statistical-reference-datasets ; official scikit-learn documentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html and https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html . Read returned source content and bounded claims to inspected passages.
- Implemented eight static pages, 47 source-linked rows, six research hypotheses, eight proposed gates, pricing specification, leaderboard policy, blank dependence register and seven review issues. No authorized observations acquired, no performance results invented. Research is a specification, not a fitted betting system.
- Verification: reviewed source-to-claim scope per generated row; links on proposal rows support background, not efficacy. All internal navigation targets exist; official-domain/source coverage and blank numeric result tests pass. Initial page-count expectation of nine was corrected to the actual eight categories. Three automated tests pass. External source pages fetched successfully; no unsupported claim that every outgoing third-party navigation link was crawled.
- F01–F07 are published on docs/review.html and have status needs review: data rights, price archive, unavailable empirical metrics, injury redirect, stale FAQ example, unvalidated methods, unfunded/unimplemented operations. These do not block publishing the research site.
- Integration collision: origin/main advanced with PR #2 from another session during implementation. Rebase detected shared COORDINATION conflict; aborted rebase, merged main to preserve published branch history. Combined both README and coordination documents without discarding either session. Other session's root site, data and assets remain untouched. This session's dashboard is independently published under /Own4/docs/ by existing root legacy Pages. No other-session scoped files edited.
- Pages settings API returned 403 Resource not accessible by integration; retained working existing legacy root configuration instead. Workflow validates only; legacy Pages handles deployment. Prior statements describing Actions deployment are superseded by this entry.

## Session 34832d14-own4: concurrent handoff and conflict log (2026-11-02 UTC)

- Initial empty checkout led to independent simultaneous claim and research work before any other claim was visible. Session #2 and #3 subsequently merged to main; their root site and `docs/` dashboard are canonical. PR #4 was initially mergeable but became conflicting when #3 merged during the check/merge window. The first merge attempt failed safely without changing main.
- Pulled current main into this Arena-managed branch. Conflicts in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, `COORDINATION.md`, `README.md` and five `docs/*.html` pages were resolved in favor of the already merged canonical main versions; this note preserves the handoff. No other session's published work was discarded. Superseded duplicate catalog/UI are removed from this contribution.
- This session's independent pure calculation functions and deterministic synthetic tests remain as an additive research tool. They make no real NBA edge claims. Main site uses [NBA Stats FAQ](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/faq) and [NBA glossary](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary) for official context; betting source terms/odds and empirical correlations remain unverified.
- Original review also found a historical NBA injury PDF in official-domain search results but direct PDF retrieval failed; it was not treated as live availability. Legacy Pages settings could not be changed via API (403); canonical main uses existing Pages configuration.
