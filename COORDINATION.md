## Log

- 2026-11-02 — Session arena-689eb52e-own4 claimed tasks 1–7 (sole active session; no other claims found). Repo was empty except README.md ("# Own4"). No conflicts.
- 2026-11-02 — All research rows cite official/trusted sources (nba.com, official.nba.com, stats.nba.com, gleague.nba.com, ncpgambling.org). Market/odds values and correlation coefficients that cannot be confirmed from an official source are left blank and listed on the Flagged for Review page.
- 2026-11-02 — PR link and merge result: (to be recorded after merge)

## Verification notes

- Every table row on the site carries a source link. Unverifiable values are blank + flagged.
- Site is static (no build step); link integrity checked by scanning all hrefs against files present.

Session: arena-1805bfdb (final integration session). Work remains on assigned branch `arena/1805bfdb-own4`; additional branches are not permitted by this environment.

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|

## Activity
- 2026-11-02: Initial repository contains only README.md (`# Own4`); no implementation, datasets, claims, credentials or other session claims found. Claimed initial implementation and final integration. No parallel tasks exist.
- Initial claim push: remote session branch did not yet exist; pull from that ref failed without changing files. Rebased against origin/main and created only the assigned remote branch. No conflict or other-session changes.
- 2026-11-02: Reviewed official NBA glossary https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary ; FAQ https://www.nba.com/stats/help/faq ; current injury index https://official.nba.com/nba-injury-report-2026-27-season/ ; NIST https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35c.htm and https://www.nist.gov/itl/sed/statistical-reference-datasets ; official scikit-learn documentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html and https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html . Read returned source content and bounded claims to inspected passages.
- Implemented eight static pages, 47 source-linked rows, six research hypotheses, eight proposed gates, pricing specification, leaderboard policy, blank dependence register and seven review issues. No authorized observations acquired, no performance results invented. Research is a specification, not a fitted betting system.
- Verification: reviewed source-to-claim scope per generated row; links on proposal rows support background, not efficacy. All internal navigation targets exist; official-domain/source coverage and blank numeric result tests pass. Initial page-count expectation of nine was corrected to the actual eight categories. Three automated tests pass. External source pages fetched successfully; no unsupported claim that every outgoing third-party navigation link was crawled.
- F01–F07 are published on docs/review.html and have status needs review: data rights, price archive, unavailable empirical metrics, injury redirect, stale FAQ example, unvalidated methods, unfunded/unimplemented operations. These do not block publishing the research site.
- Integration collision: origin/main advanced with PR #2 from another session during implementation. Rebase detected shared COORDINATION conflict; aborted rebase, merged main to preserve published branch history. Combined both README and coordination documents without discarding either session. Other session's root site, data and assets remain untouched. This session's dashboard is independently published under /Own4/docs/ by existing root legacy Pages. No other-session scoped files edited.
- Pages settings API returned 403 Resource not accessible by integration; retained working existing legacy root configuration instead. Workflow validates only; legacy Pages handles deployment. Prior statements describing Actions deployment are superseded by this entry.

## Additional session log · arena/3c4bdb06-own4

- 2026-11-02: Initially found only README.md, created the board and implemented an independently verified static site/framework on the fixed branch. Source verification checked NBA Stats glossary, NBA Stats FAQ (including its restriction against personal/academic downloads), NBA Official 2026–27 injury policy and GitHub Pages documentation. Candidate results remained unmeasured; local links/tests passed.
- Opened PR #5 (https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own4/pull/5). Before merge, `origin/main` advanced with concurrently integrated PRs #2 and #3, including another complete implementation of this task. Merge attempt found add/add and content conflicts across shared site files. To preserve the already merged sessions' work and avoid duplicate shared outputs, resolved all overlapping files in favor of origin/main, retaining that work and its data/docs/tests; this branch's duplicate review page/checker were dropped. This integration source is retained as a record, not as competing site output.
- PR #5 initially could not merge due to concurrent changes; after merging origin/main while retaining the already-integrated implementation, PR #5 merged successfully at https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own4/pull/5 (merge commit `1969cba8cb378d1879de740d3b40d363b082676c`, 2026-11-02). The workflow validation on main passed (run https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own4/actions/runs/41496072390). The latest Pages build reported `built` for main SHA `81000d290382b64913520f77a2fa25d4773069e3` (run https://github.com/sassnarep3-star/Own4/actions/runs/41496206249; Pages API status `built`). However, a public URL check at https://sassnarep3-star.github.io/Own4/ returned `# Own4` and `/Own4/docs/` returned 404, inconsistent with the merged dashboard; publication is therefore flagged as not independently confirmed despite successful build/deploy status. Earlier deployment attempts were cancelled by newer builds. Preserve this mismatch for follow-up rather than claiming a successful live site.
