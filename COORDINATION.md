# COORDINATION — shared task board

Read this file before starting any work. Claim a task by writing your session ID and file scope below, then commit and push immediately. Never start a task another session has claimed. Edit only files inside your claimed scope. Shared outputs (site index/navigation, combined table data) are changed only by the final integration session (T9).

**Status values:** `unclaimed` · `in progress` · `done` · `needs review` (published on the *Flagged for Review* page; does not block anything).

**Stale-claim rule:** a claim older than 60 minutes with no commits may be taken over by any session; note the handoff in the log.

## Branch-name deviation (logged)

The task brief asks for per-task branches named `session-<id>/<task>`. This session runs inside a harness that pins it to ONE branch, `arena/bf34205f-own4`, and forbids creating or pushing other branches. All tasks below were therefore done sequentially on that single branch by session `bf34205f`, with one commit per task. No other session was present on the repo at start (only `README.md` existed, one commit, no open PRs, no other remote branches).
